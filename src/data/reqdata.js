      question: "Do I have to pay tax on crypto-to-crypto transactions?",
      answer:
        "In the UK, trading one cryptocurrency for another, like Bitcoin for Ether, is considered taxable, and you may have to pay Capital Gains Tax. When you trade, it's seen as if you're selling your cryptocurrency, which is a taxable event. They don't pay attention to what you're buying with it, just that you're getting rid of one asset. So, if you make a profit, you'll owe Capital Gains Tax. In simple terms, buying, swapping, and trading cryptocurrencies with each other can be subject to tax in the UK."
